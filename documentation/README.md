## What is it

Project Gen42 is the easy to use freely available pythonic module. We consider that the module will be use by non-professional  data science users to implement experiments  in population genomics using machine and deep learning techniques and professional data scientist who know little in population genomics.

Under heavy development now; guides and instructions will magically appear here when we're stable.



## Usage

Still under heavy development, consider this a preview.
Requires python 3.8+, msprime

```sh
$ pip install ????
$ python run 

import ???? 

????.__version__
ver 1.0.0

```

## Examples

Check out the GITHUB to see different use cases of the module.
